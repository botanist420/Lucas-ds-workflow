Finally, the fitness classes schedule is back to normal after the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. However, they have received many complaints from the customers about having a hard time booking a fitness class.\n","\n","From initial analysis, the program operation team found out that the fitness classes are always fully booked but are having a low attendance rate per class. To improve this situation, they would like to increase the class capacity for customers to sign up if a low attendance rate is predicted.  \n","\n","\n","## Customer Question\n","The operation manager has asked you to answer the following:\n","- Can you predict the attendance rate for each fitness class? \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54ca6b9b-1826-423f-a386-fc26c6c250d7","metadata":{"tags":[]},"source":["## Dataset\n","The dataset contains the attendance information for the class scheduled this year so far.
